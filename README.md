# Local Remote Frontend

This project is the forntend of **_<u>Local Remote Project</u>_**. In this project I've created a Local Remote which can be used to control your media on your windows system. This project uses _React, Typescript, Material UI and Bootstrap_ in the frontend and uses _Flask, WinSDK, Dotenv_ in the backend. The frontend and backend communicated using a proxy setup in your setup. You can Run both of the components in your system locally and access it with your local devices using the local IP of the host system. I've made the default port of frontend as 80 so that need of entering the port with IP is eliminated.

**Note: Feel free to drop suggestions as issues.**
